Included Files:
    * interface.py
    * synthEngine.py
    * serialReader.py
    * serialWritter.cpp

Interface.py program contains 7 functions and 1 class:
   
    >>>> Functions
    * selectMode
    * selectGraphMode
    * editSourceMode
    * editFilterMode
    * editLFOMode
    * editADSRMode
    * run

    >>>> Classes
    * SynthUI

synthEngine.py module contains 5 functions and 6 classes:
    
    >>>> Functions
    * plt2Img
    * midi
    * Array2PySound
    * playArray
    * noise

    >>>>> Classes
    * SoundController
    * Oscillator
    * Synth
    * Filter
    * Envelope
    * LFO

serialReader.py and serialWritter.cpp are helper files to get input from the Arduino

-- Program Usgae --
For the first time usage you must configure your Arduino in the configuration shown in the image file. Then run `` make && make upload `` with the arduino plugged in.
Once its completed, the prgram can now be run. The frontend program for our project is the interface.py program.
usage: run ``python3 synthEngine.py`` in the terminal.
A GUI will appear showing all the Synths than can be edited. The joy stick on the arduino is used for navoagation to move bewteen modes and synths.
